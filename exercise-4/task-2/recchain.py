"""Recursive PeopleChain implementation.

This is an alternate implementation of the PeopleChain class
from Exercise 3.
The major difference is that there is no more Person class;
links are stored between PeopleChain objects, rather than Person objects.

Thus most methods now use the following approach:
- do something with the leader of the chain
- do something with the rest of the chain
  (which is another) PeopleChain objects
