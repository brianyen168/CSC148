"""Tree class.

This is the recursive implementation of a tree data structure
from Week 7 of the course.

Note the relationship between this class and LinkedListRec;
the only major difference is that self.rest has been replaced
by self.subtrees to handle multiple recursive subparts.

This contains all of the linked list methods from the week:
lecture material, labs, and the exercise.
